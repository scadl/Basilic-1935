# Basilic-1935
This project is my second reconstruction, made taking into account current trends in open graphic platforms, providing interactivity in my projects. Like my other reconstruction, the basil was made for one of the archaeological conferences at the BSF of Moscow State University. A flat reconstruction of a possible carving on the altar barrier is also presented here. Despite the fact that this model, like the Cruze basilica, is made in 3DS Max, it has fewer errors in terms of geometry and proportions. Mostly this was made possible thanks to a slight increase in my modeling skills. Before importing into UE, it is optimized in the open Blender editor, by dissolving senseless (in terms of geometry and triangulation) vertices and faces. The textures here correspond to the real materials from which the buildings were built in Chersonesos. Mostly they all have normal and displacement maps (thanks to SSBump). To illuminate the scenes, several photometric light sources are used with the ability to dare from surfaces up to 15 times (indirect lighting). However, to increase compatibility with cross-platform compilation, the target graphics driver is fixed on OpenGL ES3. It has built-in help on the board, 2 managed cameras, an adaptive bootloader and three cross-platform options.
